In July 2019 the BBC [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49026171) that the government was considering a night-time driving ban for people who have recently passed their tests. We analysed official DfT data to show that the under 24s make up two thirds of new drivers based on practical test passes in 2018-19.
